## Classic DVD Rental Database Queries 

This project is for me to revisit the core concepts of writing SQL queries to sharpen my data manipulation and retrieval skills. 
Understanding and effectively using SQL is crucial in today's data-driven world, 
where the ability to quickly and accurately extract insights from databases is highly valued across many industries.


I chose PostgreSQL because it's a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that's widely used in the industry. 
I used the demo database from [Postgres Tutorial site](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/). 
 

## Practice Queries 

### Aggregate Functions

1) Find the total amount of payments received by each staff member.
1) Calculate the average rental duration for all films.
1) Identify the most popular film category among customers in a certain city.

### Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

1) Find the movies that have never been rented out.
1) List customers who have spent more than the average expenditure on rentals.
1) Determine the top 5 most frequently rented films.

### Intermediate Queries using Aggregation, Subqueries, and CTEs

1) Calculate the total revenue generated by each store.
1) Identify customers who have rented movies more times than the average customer.
1) Find the actor who has appeared in the most rented films.
1) Analyze how the popularity of different film categories has changed over time (e.g., month by month or year by year).
1) List films that were never rented out during the year of 2005.
1) For each city, identify the top 3 customers based on the number of rentals.
1) Calculate the average rental duration (difference between rental date and return date) for films in each rating category.
1) Determine the most frequently rented film category for each store.

### Advanced Queries

1) Identify customers who have rented the same movie more than once.
1) Find films that are not currently in stock at a specific store.
1) Create a report that shows the monthly revenue growth.

### Bonus Challenge - Using Functions and Procedures

1) Write a function to calculate late fees for rentals.
1) Create a stored procedure to process returns and update inventory.
